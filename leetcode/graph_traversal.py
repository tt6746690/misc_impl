"""
bfs
- it uses a queue (First In First Out)
- it checks whether a vertex has been explored before enqueueing the vertex rather than delaying this check until the vertex is dequeued from the queue.


```
procedure BFS(G, root) is
    let Q be a queue
    label root as explored
    Q.enqueue(root)
    while Q is not empty do
        v := Q.dequeue()
        if v is the goal then
            return v
        for all edges from v to w in G.adjacentEdges(v) do
            if w is not labeled as explored then
                label w as explored
                w.parent := v
                Q.enqueue(w)
```
dfs
- it uses a stack
- it delays checking whether a vertex has been discovered until the vertex is popped from the stack rather than making this check before adding the vertex.
    - implying that there is the possibility of duplicate vertices on the stack, with worst-case space complexity of O(|E|)

```
procedure DFS_iterative(G, v) is
    let S be a stack
    S.push(v)
    while S is not empty do
        v = S.pop()
        if v is not labeled as discovered then
            label v as discovered
            for all edges from v to w in G.adjacentEdges(v) do 
                S.push(w)

- Stack-based graph traversal â‰  depth first search

- bfs more suitable for finding shortest path, while dfs is more suitable for finding longest path
- bfs is more predictable
- can replace list with `deque` implementation. 
    ```
    from collections import deque
    # queue: popleft() and append()
    # stack: pop()     and append()
